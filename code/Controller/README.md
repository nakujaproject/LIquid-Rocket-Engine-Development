# Introduction
This repository holds the code that allows for and shows proof for dynamic regenerative cooling in a liquid rocket engine.

# Working
The proof is shown by turing on the heater for a certain amount of time and running the coolant at one base flow rate that keeps the temperature constant. A rise in the heater temperature should result in an increase in flow rate to keep the temperature within the same desired window.

The user, through our UI, inputs the desired temperature window and the system computes the required coolant flow rate depending on the current sensor readings.
