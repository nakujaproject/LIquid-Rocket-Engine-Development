## Description
Below are the graphs of the temperature comparisons of the coil vs the outside of the chamber walls.
We heated the coil at 2 different rates; ~50% and ~75%.

The graphs show that the temperature of the outside wall is about 30% of the inside temperature. Eg. The wall temperature was barely 200°C when the coil temperature was 670°C.

These are 6 curves.

The 1st curve represents the coil temperature with 75% heating rate.
The next 2 curves represent the coil temp with 50% heating rate.
The last 3 curves represent the outside wall temperatures, the top being with 75% and the other two with 50%.

A second finding is that the outside temperature doesn't change spontaneously with the coil temperature. We can see the 3 outside wall temperatures are about the same.

## ToDo

However, they are all well above the boiling point of water, thus we'll see how to go about that challenge when we conduct the water test.
