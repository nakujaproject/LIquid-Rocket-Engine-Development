This repository contains work done in addition to work done previously on the liquid rocket engine during the internship period of 2023 by the liquid propulsion team.

## Milestones
so far, the following has been achieved previously:
- [x] Design of components
- [x] Fabrication of components
- [x] assembly of engine, pintle injector & test stand to run the setup
- [x] Demonstrations (Seperately).


## ToDo
next up, our goals are:
- [] completion of test stand for fuel and oxidizer supply
- [] water test (low pressure)
- [] water test (high pressure tests)
- [] ignition test

## Points to note:
- -> We noticed from designing of spacer that it is wise to design the spacer after the fabrication of the combustion chamber has taken place. This prevents inconsistencies from the dimensions of the combustion chamber after fabrication.
